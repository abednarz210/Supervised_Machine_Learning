## Background

LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that allows individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. LendingClub offers their previous data through an API. Using this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Preprocessing

* Convert categorical data to numeric
* Consider the models
* Create and compare two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier.
* Fit a LogisticRegression model and RandomForestClassifier model


## Results 

The Random Forest Classifier Model after scaling performed better than the Logistic Regression model when scaled as previously predicted. The inital Random Forest Classifer training score was 0.79 and test score was 1.0.
